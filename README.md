# -Novel-Approach-for-Image-Enhancement
Downloaded the dataset and Implemented the Base paper a little bit. 
Paper we tried to implement:  Liu S, Chen P, Wo≈∫niak M. Image Enhancement-Based Detection with Small Infrared Targets. Remote Sensing. 2022; 14(13):3232.
Later we tried to increase its performance by using lanczos2 upsampling for spatial filtering and lanczos interpolation
